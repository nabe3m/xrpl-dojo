A testnet evnironment is provided in XRPL.

The testnet allows developers to develop products having the mainnet in mind. The main reason for using a testnet is that the mainnet requires the developer to bear a certain amount of `XRP` as fees and account reserves.

The following is one of the commonly used testnet environment.

`wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233`

There are several other testnet environments that do exist, please refer to [here](https://xrpl.org/resources/dev-tools/xrp-faucets/).

## Creating the Script

<Steps>

1. Create a new file named `connect.js` in your project directory 
2. Paste the following code into `connect.js`.

   ```javascript
   const xrpl = require('xrpl'); // Load the xrpl library.

   async function main() {
     // async
     // Connectting to the Testnet server, which is a test network for XRP Ledger development.
     // Create a client to connect to XRP Ledger's Testnet server using the xrpl.Client class
     const client = new xrpl.Client('wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233');

     // Connect to the server by calling the client.connect() method.
     // Use "await" to wait for the connection to complete.
     await client.connect();

     // If the connection is successful, a message is output to the console.
     console.log('Connected to the XRP Ledger Testnet');

     // Disconnect from the server by calling the client.disconnect() method.
     client.disconnect();
   }

   main().catch(console.error);
     // Call the main function to start the program.
     // catch(console.error) is used to output error messages to the console if an error occurs.
   ```

   The script simply connects to XRP Ledger's Testnet, displays to the console that the connection was successful, and then closes the connection.

</Steps>

## Running the Script

<Steps>
1. Run the script by executing the following command on the command line.

   ```bash
   node connect.js
   ````
   
2. If successful, you will see the following in the console.

   ```bash
   Connected to the XRP Ledger Testnet
   ```
