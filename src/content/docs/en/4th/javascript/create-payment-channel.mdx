In this chapter, we will introduce how to create a payment channel.

Simply put, a payment channel allows payments to be made from a deposited amount of `XRP` at a later time. By creating a channel and making a deposit in advance, off-chain payments become possible.

Additionally, XRPL's payment channel functionality is provided natively, without the need for smart contracts or external dependencies. This ensures safe transactions (*) and makes the feature developer-friendly.

*Except for core bugs in XRPL.

## Creating the Script

<Steps>

1. Create a new file named `createPaymentChannel.js` in your project directory.
2. Paste the following code into `createAccounts.js`.

    ```javascript
    import { xrpToDrops, unixTimeToRippleTime } from 'xrpl';
    import { client, aliceWallet, bobWallet } from './config.js';

    const createPaymentChannel = async () => {
        try {
            const tx = {
                TransactionType: 'PaymentChannelCreate', // Transaction type: PaymentChannelCreate
                Account: bobWallet.address, // Sender's (Bob's) account address
                Amount: xrpToDrops('10'), // Amount of XRP to deposit in the channel (10 XRP here)
                Destination: aliceWallet.address, // Recipient's (Alice's) account address
                SettleDelay: 86400, // Grace period before the source address can close the channel if there is unclaimed XRP. Waiting time in seconds (1 day here)
                PublicKey: bobWallet.publicKey, // Sender's (Bob's) public key
                CancelAfter: CancelAfter: unixTimeToRippleTime(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 86400 * 7), // Seconds until the channel can be canceled (1 month here)
            };

            console.log('Submitting a PaymentChannelCreate transaction...');

            const paymentChannelResponse = await client.submitAndWait(tx, {
                wallet: bobWallet,
            });

            console.log(
                'PaymentChannelCreate transaction response:',
                paymentChannelResponse
            );

            // Get the channel_id
            const response = await client.request({
                command: 'account_channels',
                account: bobWallet.address,
            });

            const channelId = response.result.channels[0].channel_id;
            console.log(`Created Payment Channel with ID: ${channelId}`);

            return channelId;
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error creating Payment Channel:', error);
        }
    };

    const main = async () => {
        try {
            await client.connect();
            const channelId = await createPaymentChannel();
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error connecting to XRPL:', error);
        } finally {
            await client.disconnect();
        }
    };

    main();
    ```

    <Aside title="About Ripple Epoch">
    The `CancelAfter` field must be specified in Ripple Epoch.
    
    Ripple Epoch is a specification unique to the `rippled` server.
    The start time of the Ripple Epoch is January 1, 2000, 00:00:00 UTC, which is 946684800 seconds behind the UNIX timestamp.

    Since the standard UNIX timestamp is based on January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC, there is a time difference between it and the Ripple Epoch.

    In xrpl.js, a `unixTimeToRippleTime` method is provided, allowing you to easily convert UNIX timestamps.

    Additionally, please note that there are fields specified in Ripple Epoch for each function in XRPL.

## Running the Script

<Steps>

1. Run the script by executing the following command in your command line:

    ```bash
    node createPaymentChannel.js
    ```

2. If successful, the console will display the following:
    ```bash
    Submitting a PaymentChannelCreate transaction...
    PaymentChannelCreate transaction response: {
        id: 10,
        result: {
            Account: 'rDW8W3rzDFUyU4pw5Ei8QL1J9nQ947h68f',
            Amount: '10000000',
            CancelAfter: 1719738684,
            Destination: 'rM6Nt2E1WKJLKMN1tbkcifveAshzVuyJmj',
            Fee: '12',
            Flags: 0,
            LastLedgerSequence: 1742776,

            Sequence: 1742740,
            SettleDelay: 86400,
            SigningPubKey: 'ED9F9B58A0A209A1D0F90832FE83F3ED49C0091259E3F67A2FCAA3D3EAAF718FFE',
            TransactionType: 'PaymentChannelCreate',
            TxnSignature: '8B87011388FFED13070AFB88D936D7903D26A481036043ABD27BEC13CA5531610A667BCFE18B2F7090EB04E611EAFDC3DA0082C72937FCB9DB2EEDE6AA5F4602',
            ctid: 'C01A97A600070001',
            date: 772449090,
            hash: '860DD9F668836971343AE84BE111D451A3F0C4BBE4BD92E36D3BCAC5E2571BB4',
            inLedger: 1742758,
            ledger_index: 1742758,
            meta: {
                AffectedNodes: [Array],
                TransactionIndex: 7,
                TransactionResult: 'tesSUCCESS'
            },
            validated: true
        },
        type: 'response'
    }
    Created Payment Channel with ID: 25C67138FB51F65A7015632C07E00AD0AE1C8A21F0282FD0401BAEDFDFD3423E
    ```

    The ID displayed at the end of the log (`25C67138FB51F65A7015632C07E00AD0AE1C8A21F0282FD0401BAEDFDFD3423E`) is the `Channel ID`, so make a note of it.

    <Aside>
    The `channelId` is a unique identifier for the payment channel on the XRPL (XRP Ledger).
    This ID is generated when the payment channel is created and is needed for operations such as adding funds, claiming, and closing the channel.
    </Aside>

    In actual development, you will need to carry forward this ID to perform off-chain transactions and other operations.

</Steps>

Next, we will perform off-chain transactions using the created Channel ID. The specific steps will be explained in the next section.
