In this chapter, we will introduce how to add funds (deposit) to an existing payment channel.

## Creating the Script

<Steps>

1. Create a new file named `fundPaymentChannel.js` in your project directory.

2. Paste the following code into `fundPaymentChannel.js`.

    ```javascript
    import { xrpToDrops } from 'xrpl';
    import { client, bobWallet } from './config.js';

    const fundPaymentChannel = async (channelId) => {
        try {
            const tx = {
                TransactionType: 'PaymentChannelFund', // Transaction type: Adding funds to the payment channel
                Account: bobWallet.address, // Sender (Bob)'s account address
                Channel: channelId, // Payment channel ID
                Amount: xrpToDrops('5'), // Amount of XRP to add to the channel (in this case, 5 XRP)
            };

            console.log('Submitting a PaymentChannelFund transaction...');

            // Submit the transaction
            const fundChannelResponse = await client.submitAndWait(tx, {
                wallet: bobWallet,
            });

            console.log(
                'PaymentChannelFund transaction response:',
                fundChannelResponse
            );
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error funding Payment Channel:', error);
        }
    };

    const main = async () => {
        try {
            await client.connect();
            const channelId = 'CHANNEL_ID_HERE'; // Enter the previously created channel ID
            await fundPaymentChannel(channelId);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error connecting to XRPL:', error);
        } finally {
            await client.disconnect();
        }
    };

    main();
    ```
</Steps>


## Running the Script

<Steps>

1. Run the script by executing the following command in your command line:

    ```bash
    node fundPaymentChannel.js
    ```

2. If successful, the console will display the following:

   ```javascript
    Submitting a PaymentChannelFund transaction...
    PaymentChannelFund transaction response: {
        id: 12,
            result: {
                Account: 'rDW8W3rzDFUyU4pw5Ei8QL1J9nQ947h68f',
                Amount: '5000000',
                Channel: '25C67138FB51F65A7015632C07E00AD0AE1C8A21F0282FD0401BAEDFDFD3423E',
                Fee: '12',
                Flags: 0,
                LastLedgerSequence: 1743984,
                Sequence: 1742741,
                SigningPubKey: 'ED9F9B58A0A209A1D0F90832FE83F3ED49C0091259E3F67A2FCAA3D3EAAF718FFE',
                TransactionType: 'PaymentChannelFund',
                TxnSignature: '0BB94472B22EEC345F02E5E788DA5CBBDB3080082DD03F3B5A87D02116FC61FF36B6469002B90CF8F219BDE9CFAD4AC68B49EAE64ED96C2A58FB9F09A8DDF00D',
                ctid: 'C01A9C5E007D0001',
                date: 772453171,
                hash: 'AA71F4F3163A25032BC71A07C8824C62415F33A3BD20F6B578A5236F4DED4631',
                inLedger: 1743966,
                ledger_index: 1743966,
                meta: {
                    AffectedNodes: [Array],
                    TransactionIndex: 125,
                    TransactionResult: 'tesSUCCESS'
                },
                validated: true
            },
        type: 'response'
    }
    ```
</Steps>

## Extending the Expiration Date

You can extend the expiration date while adding funds.

To extend the expiration date, add the `Expiration` field as shown below when submitting the transaction.  
The `Expiration` field must specify a date later than the current date plus `SettleDelay`.

```javascript
const tx = {
    TransactionType: 'PaymentChannelFund', // Transaction type: Adding funds to the payment channel
    Account: bobWallet.address, // Sender (Bob)'s account address
    Channel: channelId, // Payment channel ID
    Amount: xrpToDrops('5'), // Amount of XRP to add to the channel (in this case, 5 XRP)
    Expiration: unixTimeToRippleTime(Date.now() + 86400 * 7 * 1000), // Extend expiration date (in this case, 1 week later)
};
```

Note: The expiration date is different from the CancelAfter option, which cannot be changed.

## Checking the Channel's State

To verify that the funds have been added, check the channel's state again.

Use the previously created `checkChannelBalance.js`.

### Running the Script

<Steps>

1. Run the script by executing the following command in your command line:

    ```bash
    node checkChannelBalance.js
    ```

2. If successful, the console will display the following:

    ```bash
    Channel ID: 25C67138FB51F65A7015632C07E00AD0AE1C8A21F0282FD0401BAEDFDFD3423E
    Balance: 1000000 drops // Amount of off-ledger transactions (currently: 1 XRP)
    Amount: 15000000 drops // Amount deposited (15 XRP)
    ```

    You can confirm that the Amount has increased to `15000000 drops (15 XRP)`.

    <Aside title="About Balance">
    The `Balance` obtained above does not represent the currently claimable amount.  
    It indicates how much of the deposited amount has been transacted so far. Off-ledger transactions can be conducted up to the `Amount` limit.
    </Aside>
</Steps>

## Summary

In this chapter, we explained how to add funds to a payment channel.

Using the `PaymentChannelFund` transaction, you can make additional deposits to the channel.
You can refer to this sample code to generate a transaction, for example, when clicking a "Deposit" button.

Additionally, you can extend the validity period of the channel, allowing for more transactions.

In the next chapter, we will introduce how to close a payment channel. By going through the closing process, you can reclaim unused funds and finalize the channel's remaining balance.
