## Introduction

In the "Level 4" of the XRPL Dojo, we will introduce "Advanced Payment Features."

Advanced payment features in XRPL refer to functionalities such as:

- PaymentChannel (Off-chain payment channels)
- Checks
- Escrow (Deposits)
- Clawback (Refunds)

In XRPL, existing financial concepts (such as check functionalities) are provided natively, eliminating the need to write smart contracts.

## Goals

1. Understand the use cases of each payment feature.
2. Learn how to implement each payment feature.

## Prerequisites

This guide will proceed with the following characters:

- Alice (Recipient)
- Bob (Sender)

Two accounts are sufficient to proceed with this guide. Please prepare two testnet accounts in advance from [here](https://xrpl.org/resources/dev-tools/xrp-faucets/) and note them down.

Here is a template for your notes:
