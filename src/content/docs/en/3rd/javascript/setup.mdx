Let's start by creating the project.

## Creating the Project

From now on, we will proceed using a more modern setup method.

First, create a project as usual.


```bash
// Create and navigate to the directory
mkdir xrpl-cross-currency
cd xrpl-cross-currency

// Initialize the project
npm init -y
npm install xrpl
```

## Enabling ES6 Modules

Next, enable ES6 modules by adding the following setting to your `package.json`.

It doesn't matter where you place it, but make sure to modify it as shown below.

```json
{
  "name": "xrpl-cross-currency",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "type": "module", // Add this line
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": "",
  "dependencies": {
    "xrpl": "^3.0.0"
  }
}

```
