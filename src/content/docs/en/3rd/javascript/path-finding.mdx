This guide explains cross-currency payments by dealing with `A.USD` issued by Issuer A and `B.EUR` issued by Issuer B.

In the previous section, Alice provided liquidity by placing an offer to sell `A.USD` issued by Issuer A and buy `B.EUR` issued by Issuer B.

In this section, before executing a cross-currency payment, we will introduce the path_find command to search for payment paths.

## Prerequisites
Alice has already provided liquidity by placing an offer to sell `A.USD` issued by Issuer A and buy `B.EUR` issued by Issuer B.

Daniel needs to make a payment to Charlie, who wants to receive `A.USD`. However, Daniel currently does not hold any `A.USD`.

Daniel only holds XRP or `B.EUR` issued by Issuer B and is considering whether he can exchange his `B.EUR`. If someone is willing to exchange `B.EUR` for the desired amount of `A.USD`, Daniel should be able to send his `B.EUR` as `A.USD` to Charlie.

Daniel wants to search if it is possible to send his `B.EUR` to Charlie as `A.USD`.

## Creating the Script

<Steps>

1. Create a new file named `pathFinding.js` in your project directory.
2. Paste the following code into `pathFinding.js`.

    ```javascript
    import { Client, xrpToDrops } from 'xrpl';
    import { wallets } from './wallets.js';

    const client = new Client('wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233');

    const main = async () => {
        await client.connect();

        const { issuerA, issuerB, alice, bob, charlie, daniel } = wallets;

        client.on('path_find', (stream) => {
            console.log(JSON.stringify(stream.alternatives, null, '  '));
        });

        client.request({
            command: 'path_find',
            subcommand: 'create',
            source_account: daniel.address, // Sender: Daniel
            destination_account: charlie.address, // Recipient: Charlie
            destination_amount: {
                currency: 'USD', // Currency code
                issuer: issuerA.address, // Issuer A's address
                value: '100', // Amount of A.USD Daniel wants to send to Charlie
            },
        });
    };

    main();
    ```
</Steps>


## Running the Script

<Steps>

1. Run the following command in the command line to execute the script.

    ```bash
    node pathFinding.js
    ```

2. If you see logs like the following, the operation was successful.
    ```bash
    [
        {
            "paths_computed": [
                [
                    {
                        "account": "rstM9rxhKo4N4WEaQgQmQSPQRgZqkhHkaU", // Issuer B's address
                        "type": 1
                    },
                    {
                        "currency": "USD",
                        "issuer": "rfkJ7Uz6NrNV1FdbmKB5wepoim51KFpYQp", // Issuer A's address
                        "type": 48
                    }
                ]
            ],
            "source_amount": {
                "currency": "EUR",
                "issuer": "rf6R7pFgytT9JKjMVjKqeTv6MeDTrbNw3", // Daniel's address
                "value": "100"
            }
        }
    ]
    ```
</Steps>
