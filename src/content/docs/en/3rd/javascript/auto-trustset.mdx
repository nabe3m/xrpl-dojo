Next, we will explain the behavior of trust lines when making an offer.

Let's try a scenario where Bob sells `B.EUR` issued by Issuer B and buys `A.USD` issued by Issuer A, and this `B.EUR` eventually reaches Daniel.

## Prerequisites

Charlie needs to make a payment to Daniel, who wants to receive `B.EUR`. However, at this point, Charlie does not hold `B.EUR` and only has `XRP` and `A.USD` issued by Issuer A. Therefore, Charlie considers whether he can exchange his `A.USD`.

1. Bob will create an offer to sell `B.EUR` issued by Issuer B and buy `A.USD` issued by Issuer A to provide liquidity.
2. Charlie will initiate the process to send `A.USD` as `B.EUR` to Daniel.

## Creating the Script

<Steps>

1. Use the existing `createOffers.js` to create an offer from Bob.

    ```javascript
    import { Client, xrpToDrops } from 'xrpl';
    import { wallets } from './wallets.js';
    import { createOffer } from './utils/createOffer.js';

    const client = new Client('wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233'); // Using Testnet

    async function main() {
        try {
            await client.connect();

            const { issuerA, issuerB, alice, bob, charlie, daniel } = wallets;

            // await createOffer(
            //   client,
            //   alice,
            //   { currency: 'USD', issuer: issuerA.address, value: '100' },
            //   { currency: 'EUR', issuer: issuerB.address, value: '100' }
            // );

            await createOffer(
                client,
                bob,
                { currency: 'EUR', issuer: issuerB.address, value: '100' },
                { currency: 'USD', issuer: issuerA.address, value: '100' }
            );
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Error in offer creation: ${error}`);
        } finally {
            await client.disconnect();
        }
    }

    main();
    ```

2. Use the existing `crossCurrencyPayment.js` to make a payment from Charlie.

    ```javascript
    // crossCurrencyPayment.js
    import xrpl from 'xrpl';
    import { wallets } from './wallets.js';
    import { sendPayment } from './utils/payment.js';

    const client = new xrpl.Client('wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233');

    const main = async () => {
        await client.connect();

        const { issuerA, issuerB, alice, bob, charlie, daniel } = wallets;

        // await sendPayment(
        //   client,
        //   daniel,
        //   { currency: 'USD', issuer: issuerA.address, value: '100' }, // Currency Charlie wants to receive: A.USD
        //   charlie.address,
        //   {
        //     sendMax: { currency: 'EUR', issuer: issuerB.address, value: '100' }, // Currency Daniel wants to pay: B.EUR
        //   }
        // );

        // Payment from Charlie to Daniel
        await sendPayment(
            client,
            charlie,
            { currency: 'EUR', issuer: issuerB.address, value: '100' }, // Currency Daniel wants to receive: B.EUR
            daniel.address,
            {
                sendMax: { currency: 'USD', issuer: issuerA.address, value: '100' }, // Currency Charlie wants to pay: A.USD
            }
        );

        await client.disconnect();
    };

    main().catch(console.error);
    ```
</Steps>


## Running the Script

<Steps>

1. Run the following commands in the command line to execute the script.

    ```bash
    node createOffers.js
    node crossCurrencyPayment.js
    ```

2. If the following log appears as a result of `crossCurrencyPayment.js`, it is successful.
    ```bash
    Payment sent from rnP7Q6LaejYi7oaN4qJHkKhnESZYAyVQwh to rf6R7pFgytT9JKjMVjKqeTv6MeDTrbNw3: {
        id: 14,
        result: {
            Account: 'rnP7Q6LaejYi7oaN4qJHkKhnESZYAyVQwh', // Charlie
            Amount: {
                currency: 'EUR',
                issuer: 'rstM9rxhKo4N4WEaQgQmQSPQRgZqkhHkaU', // issuerB
                value: '100'
            },
            DeliverMax: {
                currency: 'EUR',
                issuer: 'rstM9rxhKo4N4WEaQgQmQSPQRgZqkhHkaU',
                value: '100'
            },
            Destination: 'rf6R7pFgytT9JKjMVjKqeTv6MeDTrbNw3', // Daniel
            Fee: '12',
            Flags: 0,
            LastLedgerSequence: 1085862,
            SendMax: {
                currency: 'USD',
                issuer: 'rfkJ7Uz6NrNV1FdbmKB5wepoim51KFpYQp', // issuerA
                value: '100' // Max amount
            },
            Sequence: 1046427,
            SigningPubKey: 'ED88C6BDCFE0FB8612FCE299211DDAB0E6E6498EEAD14D07673D7C2C0778361766',
            TransactionType: 'Payment',
            TxnSignature: 'CE013A27741315A5DE67B811DF4AA793F3CBF24AA80D0EED9A1148B790A6A9713B1DE457BF3F3EECC5C155A8CA81D9536F7C151239DF6BEBA13BFCA057255E02',
            ctid: 'C010919400000001',
            date: 770335361,
            hash: '95CE240790C3B1AA5C59CB1C1A4747B42901B06F3F4217C5BFC3E4F07D372E07',
            inLedger: 1085844,
            ledger_index: 1085844,
            meta: {
                AffectedNodes: [Array],
                TransactionIndex: 0,
                TransactionResult: 'tesSUCCESS', // Success
                delivered_amount: [Object]
            },
            validated: true
        },
        type: 'response'
    }
    ```

    At this point, please check the [explorer](https://test.bithomp.com/explorer/) to confirm the following:

    1. Bob's balance of `B.EUR` decreased to `900`, and his balance of `A.USD` increased to `100`.
    2. Charlie's balance of `A.USD` increased to `1,000` (returned to the initial state).
    3. Daniel's balance of `B.EUR` increased to `1,000` (returned to the initial state).

</Steps>

## About Trust Lines

Bob is able to hold `A.USD` even though he did not explicitly set a trust line for it.

This is the behavior triggered by the `OfferCreate` transaction, and you can interpret it as "placing an order for `A.USD` = trusting `A.USD`".

In the next chapter, we will explain cross-currency payment patterns and more.
