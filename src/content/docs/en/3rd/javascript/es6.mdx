ES6 modules are a mechanism that makes it easier to reuse code in JavaScript. Introduced as part of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) in 2015, they are the standard module system for JavaScript.

Modules allow you to manage your code in separate files and import methods as needed. Most modern frameworks adopt this system, so beginners should also learn it.

## Key Features

### 1. Import and Export

- Export: Export functions, objects, or variables from a module to make them available for use in other modules.
- Import: Import functions or variables created in other modules into your own module.

### 2. Scope Isolation

Each module has its own scope (variable range), preventing variable collisions between modules.

Here's an example of how scope isolation works.

Create module1.js.

```javascript
// module1.js
export const name = 'Alice';

export function greet() {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

Next, create a similar code file named module2.js.

```javascript
// module2.js
export const name = 'Bob';

export function greet() {
  return `Hi, ${name}!`;
}
```

Let's import the above modules in `main.js`.

```javascript
// main.js
import { name as name1, greet as greet1 } from './module1.js';
import { name as name2, greet as greet2 } from './module2.js';

console.log(name1);  // Alice
console.log(greet1());  // Hello, Alice!

console.log(name2);  // Bob
console.log(greet2());  // Hi, Bob!
```
In this example, both module1.js and module2.js define a variable called name. However, since each module has its own scope, the name variable in each module does not interfere with the name variable in the other module.

Additionally, in main.js, the name variables and greet functions imported from each module are used, but naming conflicts are avoided by giving them different names (name1 and name2).

## Export Methods

There are two ways to export in ES6: named exports and default exports.

### Named Export

```javascript
// functions.js
export function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

export function subtract(x, y) {
  return x - y;
}
```

### Default Export

```javascript
// multiply.js
export default function multiply(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}
```

## Import Methods

### Importing Named Exports

```javascript
// main.js
import { add, subtract } from './functions.js';

console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
console.log(subtract(5, 2)); // 3
```

### Importing Default Exports

```javascript
// main.js
import multiply from './multiply.js';

console.log(multiply(2, 3)); // 6
```

## Summary

Using ES6 modules makes it easier to organize your code and increases reusability!

In complex projects, dividing your code into modules makes management easier and development more efficient.
