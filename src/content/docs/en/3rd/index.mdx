## Introduction

In the XRPL Dojo -DOJO- "Part 3", we will delve deeper into DEX (Decentralized Exchange) by introducing "Cross-Currency Payments".

From the beginner to the first-dan level, we covered the basics of sending transactions, trust lines, and tokens. In the second-dan level, we explained how to create, check, and cancel offers on the DEX.

This guide will explain the overview and implementation of cross-currency payments as an advanced topic.

Additionally, this time we will also cover how to implement the frontend.

Frontend development is an essential skill for turning your ideas into reality. It allows you to develop applications that users can actually use. Let's challenge ourselves to learn it!

## Goals

1. Understand the mechanism of cross-currency payments
2. Understand the conditions under which cross-currency payments occur
3. Learn how to perform cross-currency payments through code
