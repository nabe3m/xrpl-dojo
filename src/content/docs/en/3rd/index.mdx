## Introduction

In the introductory to first-degree levels, we covered the basics of sending transactions, trust lines, and tokens. In the second-degree level, we explained how to create, view, and cancel offers on the DEX.

In this advanced guide, we will provide a step-by-step explanation of "What is cross-currency payment?" to deepen your understanding of DEX.

## Goals

1. Understand the mechanism of cross-currency payments
2. Understand the conditions under which cross-currency payments occur
3. Learn how to perform cross-currency payments through code
