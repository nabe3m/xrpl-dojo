Testnet allows you to obtain XRP, the native token, for development purposes.

There are two main methods.

## Obtain by specifying an address

The following site allows you to acquire XRP by specifying an address.

If you want to send to the account address you created earlier by code, you can use the tool at bithomb.com.

- [test.bithomp.com](https://test.bithomp.com/faucet/)

If you want to get XRP while creating an address, go on and create an account below.

- [xrpl.org](https://xrpl.org/resources/dev-tools/xrp-faucets/)

## If you want to get it by code

While it is better to use a tool for efficiency and convenience, you can also get XRP using code.

### Installing node-fetch

The fetch API is built into the browser, but in a Node.js environment, you need to install the node-fetch module.

```bash
npm install node-fetch
```

### Create Script

```javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

async function faucet() {
  try {
    // XRPL Testnet Faucet URL
    const faucetUrl = 'https://faucet.altnet.rippletest.net/accounts';

    // Send POST request using Fetch API
    const response = await fetch(faucetUrl, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const data = await response.json();
    console.log('Wallet Address:', data.account.address);
    console.log('Secret:', data.account.secret); 
    console.log('Balance:', data.balance); // display the amount of XRP granted in the test net
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error requesting XRP:', error.message); 
  }
}

faucet(); 
```

## Run script

<Steps> 

1. Run script by executing the following command on the command line.

    ```bash
    node create_wallet.js
    ````

2. If successful, you will see the following in the console.

    ```bash
    data: {
        account: {
        xAddress: 'XVBX4Scdqqvh8WukxJjvoNCSQ5CvZPCvZUPuaXaqZ2JuxH9',
            address: 'rDt3T3ifG96eKS4pkZyUxhYt8rTSpPDauf', // address
            classicAddress: 'rDt3T3ifG96eKS4pkZyUxhYt8rTSpPDauf'
        }, 
        amount: 100, // 100XRP has been obtained
        transactionHash: '6FBE1C1215B8B3D0765D3CEC2FD48EE2BBC073DB8A960A92CA0485986CFE226C',
        seed: 'sEdTYR4byoAWLJUqFCGQsZsAX6ni9tc' // secret key
    }
    ```
</Steps>
