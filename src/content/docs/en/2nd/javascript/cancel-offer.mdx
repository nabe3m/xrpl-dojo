## Introduction

The XRPL (XRP Ledger) provides native Decentralized Exchange (DEX) functionality, allowing users to create offers (orders) to buy and sell assets. In this article, we will explain how to cancel an offer created on XRPL.

## Preparation

Please prepare the wallet address used in the previous section when creating offers.

## Create the Script

<Steps>

1. Create a new file named `cancel_offer.js` in your project directory.
2. Paste the following code into `cancel_offer.js`.

    ```javascript
    const xrpl = require('xrpl');

    async function cancelOffer() {
        const client = new xrpl.Client('wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233');
        await client.connect();

        const wallet = xrpl.Wallet.fromSeed('your_wallet_seed'); // Wallet seed

        const offerSequence = 123456; // Specify the sequence number of the offer you want to cancel

        const cancelTx = {
            TransactionType: 'OfferCancel', // Cancel the offer
            Account: wallet.address, // Wallet address
            OfferSequence: offerSequence // 123456
        };

        const prepared = await client.autofill(cancelTx); // Automatically complete the transaction
        const signed = wallet.sign(prepared); // Sign the transaction
        const result = await client.submitAndWait(signed.tx_blob); // Send

        console.log('Offer cancellation result:', result);
        await client.disconnect();
    }

    cancelOffer();
    ```

</Steps>

## Run the Script

<Steps>

1. Run the following command in the command line to execute the script.

    ```bash
    node cancel_offer.js
    ```
    
2. If successful, the console will display the following.

    ```bash
    Offer cancellation result: {
        id: 14,
        result: {
            Account: 'rP1WwXDZvQHvNiyenBpLvSdx3E8WuUpQc5',
            Fee: '12',
            Flags: 0,
            LastLedgerSequence: 673065,
            OfferSequence: 477853,
            Sequence: 477854,
            SigningPubKey: 'EDA0094F9DE33C9BBD4681C9D88407C92A93D7532775B08731572DA419C804BA27',
            TransactionType: 'OfferCancel',
            TxnSignature: '4F231AB487C2BFB30777841F60177E164F028BC700DC8A76845EE90FDF639B491E7C3E23EA0CF7EB7DE9D4C9139059779E0FB3BD2EF59727B6B470CA05EE7506',
            ctid: 'C00A451700100001',
            date: 769027381,
            hash: '99DF4150E96163C8A22888C9C3B7E979D9FB4E1A9497199018C0648B119908F3',
            inLedger: 673047,
            ledger_index: 673047,
            meta: {
            AffectedNodes: [Array],
            TransactionIndex: 16,
            TransactionResult: 'tesSUCCESS' // Success
            },
            validated: true
        },
        type: 'response'
    }
    ```

3. Check the offers again.

    ```bash
    node check_offers.js
    ```
    
4. If successful, the console will display the following, confirming that the offer has been successfully canceled.

    ```bash
    Offer list: []
    ```

</Steps>

## Summary

In this guide, we explained the concept of XRPL's DEX, how to create offers, and how to cancel offers on the DEX.

While dealing with DEXs generally become very complex, XRPL makes it relatively easy to interact with them using the JavaScript library.

Having covered trust lines, token issuance and transfer, and offer creation, checking, and cancellation, the next step will be an explanation on "cross-currency payments."
