As part of the XRPL Dojo -DOJO- "Level 2" curriculum, let's explore DEX (Decentralized Exchange)!

In the First Dan curriculum, we covered trust lines and tokens.

One of the challenges beginners face in XRPL development is understanding "DEX (Decentralized Exchange)."

Once you have mastered token issuance and transfer methods, you should be in a better position to understand DEX.

Let's start by actually interacting with the DEX and get comfortable with it by trying things like sending offers!

By engaging with the core technologies and mechanisms of Web3, you will get a better sense of Web3 development.

## Goals

- Understand the concept of DEX (Decentralized Exchange)
- Learn how to operate the order book
  1. Create an offer
  2. Check the offer (retrieve data)
  3. Cancel the offer

Let's move on to the next chapter to learn about XRPL's Decentralized Exchange (DEX).
