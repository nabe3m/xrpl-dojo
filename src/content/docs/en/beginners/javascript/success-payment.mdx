Finally, let's try sending `DOJ` tokens from Alice to Bob once again.

## Prerequisites

This guide proceeds with the following characters:

- Charlie (Token Issuer)
- Alice (Token Recipient 1) â€»Currently holds 1000 DOJ
- Bob (Token Recipient 2)

## Create the Script

The following is a script to send tokens from Alice to Bob.

<Steps>

1. Reuse the previously created payment_token_ab.js file in your project directory.
2. Ensure the code is as follows.

    ```javascript
    const xrpl = require('xrpl');

    async function paymentTokenAB() {
        // Connect to the Testnet server
        const client = new xrpl.Client('wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233');
        await client.connect();

        // Set Alice's wallet
        const senderWallet = xrpl.Wallet.fromSecret('alice_wallet_secret_here');

        // Set Bob's wallet address
        const recipientWalletAddress = 'bob_wallet_address_here';

        // Set the wallet address of the token issuer (Charlie)
        const issuerWalletAddress = 'charlie_wallet_address_here';

        const currencyCode = 'DOJ'; // Token currency code
        const amount = '100'; // Amount of tokens to send

        const response = await client.submitAndWait(
            {
                TransactionType: 'Payment', // Payment
                Account: senderWallet.address, // Alice's address
                Destination: recipientWalletAddress, // Bob's address
                Amount: {
                    issuer: issuerWalletAddress, // Issuer's address (Charlie)
                    currency: currencyCode, // DOJ
                    value: amount, // 100
                },
            },
            { wallet: senderWallet } // Authenticate with Alice's wallet
        );

        // Output the result to the console
        console.log('Transaction result:', response);

        // Call the client.disconnect() method to disconnect from the server
        client.disconnect();
    }

    paymentTokenAB().catch(console.error);
    ```

    1. Enter Alice's testnet secret key in `alice_wallet_secret_here`.
    2. Enter Bob's testnet address in `bob_wallet_address_here`.
    3. Enter Charlie's testnet address in `charlie_wallet_address_here`.
</Steps>

## Run the Script

<Steps>

1. Run the following command in the command line to execute the script.

    ```bash
    node payment_token_ab.js
    ```

2. Check the console result.

    ```bash
    {
        id: 16,
        result: {
            Account: 'rQr8KfkCQcpqvFwmRspDoaL36reZhcdaeA', // Sender's address (Alice)
            Amount: {
                currency: 'DOJ', // Currency code
                issuer: 'rh8xETfGs1Ktizj9EXZb5QpW4aqk8bWUSU', // Issuer's address (Charlie)
                value: '100' // Amount of tokens sent
            },
            DeliverMax: {
                currency: 'DOJ',
                issuer: 'rh8xETfGs1Ktizj9EXZb5QpW4aqk8bWUSU',
                value: '100'
            },
            Destination: 'rDNVaJJSp9iQmHC8YAAwHytnLP9aXEPhDw', // Recipient's address (Bob)
            Fee: '12',
            Flags: 0,
            LastLedgerSequence: 479728,
            Sequence: 474079,
            SigningPubKey: 'ED2924DBD08E093DD7FC9C35B8DCEBD74CA4C8349D68D7BF566AD6C2533B8BB865',
            TransactionType: 'Payment',
            TxnSignature: '6C7CB37EDC28F67E5E93D844946D3460830C8BBA5994AD882A7B30F487CE7C2FBFAECC3A286A638A6FD0BE00292E794BD3B7F4D3288087424BE0400E9062F80B',
            ctid: 'C00751DF00000001',
            date: 768417680,
            hash: '3A30D565CFF91EF55CB29E3FB1FBC61DAFDDB6FEE7707EC6C4AE835FD57413D9', // Hash value
            inLedger: 479711,
            ledger_index: 479711, // Ledger index number
            meta: {
                AffectedNodes: [Array],
                TransactionIndex: 0,
                TransactionResult: 'tesSUCCESS', // Success
                delivered_amount: [Object]
            },
            validated: true
        },
        type: 'response'
    }
    ```

    Finally, the DOJ token transfer from Alice to Bob was successful.

    Use the hash value and Alice's address displayed in the actual console to check on the testnet version of the [Explorer](https://test.bithomp.com/explorer/).

## Conclusion

In the "Level 1" curriculum, we introduced scripts, concepts, and specifications related to the trust line feature.

You may now understand what we meant by "understanding the Ripple protocol" as stated at the beginning of this guide.

For actual development, you need to understand fields and flags displayed in the console to some extent, so we deliberately introduced them in a complex manner for your future learning.

One of the major attractions of XRPL is that it provides a protocol feature based on trust for handling tokens, in addition to exchanging the native token `XRP`.

Details about IOUs and Rippling are only covered briefly in this guide. For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://xrpl.org/ja/docs/) or [articles by experts](https://zenn.dev/tequ/articles/xrpl-rippling).
