In the previous chapter, even though `Rippling` was enabled, the token transfer from Alice to Bob failed.

To identify the cause, let's check the trust line information linked to Charlie.

To retrieve trust line account information, use the account_lines command, a public method of rippled.

## Prerequisites

This guide proceeds with the following characters:

- Charlie (Token Issuer)
- Alice (Token Recipient)

## Create the Script

To check the list of trust lines, use the [account_lines](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/public-api-methods/account-methods/account_lines/) command.

<Steps>

1. Create a new file named `check_account_lines.js` in your project directory.
2. Paste the following code into `check_account_lines.js`.

    ```javascript
    const xrpl = require('xrpl');

    async function checkAccountLines(accountAddress) {
        // Connect to the Testnet
        const client = new xrpl.Client('wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233');
        await client.connect();

        try {
            // Check using the account_lines command
            const response = await client.request({
                command: 'account_lines', // Command
                account: accountAddress, // Address to check
                ledger_index: 'validated', // Retrieve from a validated ledger
            });

            // Output the result to the console
            console.log('Account Lines:', response.result.lines);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error retrieving account lines:', error);
        }

        // Call the client.disconnect() method to disconnect from the server
        client.disconnect();
    }

    // Pass the account address as an argument to the function
    const charlieAddress = 'charlie_wallet_address_here'; // Charlie's address
    checkAccountLines(charlieAddress);
    ```

    Please enter the testnet address of `Charlie in charlie_wallet_address_here`.

</Steps>

## Run the Script

<Steps>

1. Run the following command in the command line to execute the script.

    ```bash
    node check_account_lines.js
    ```

2. If successful, the console will display the following.

    ```bash
    Account Lines: [
        { // Alice
            account: 'rQr8KfkCQcpqvFwmRspDoaL36reZhcdaeA',
            balance: '-1000', // Debt to Alice
            currency: 'DOJ',
            limit: '0',
            limit_peer: '10000',
            no_ripple: true, // No Ripple flag
            no_ripple_peer: false,
            quality_in: 0,
            quality_out: 0
        },
        { // Bob
            account: 'rDNVaJJSp9iQmHC8YAAwHytnLP9aXEPhDw',
            balance: '0',
            currency: 'DOJ',
            limit: '0',
            limit_peer: '10000',
            no_ripple: true, // No Ripple flag
            no_ripple_peer: false,
            quality_in: 0,
            quality_out: 0
        }
    ]
    ```

    From the perspective of Charlie, the issuer, the trust lines linked to the accounts are shown with `no_ripple: true`.

    Additionally, the `-1000` indicates that from Charlie's perspective, there is a debt of 1000 DOJ tokens to Alice. This concept is similar to a government bond held by citizens.

## About Rippling and Trust Line Relationships

Alice and Bob have set up trust lines and have the right to receive tokens from Charlie, but the `NoRipple flag` was enabled.

<Aside title="What is the NoRipple Flag?">
When this flag is set, rippling (token movement through trust) is prohibited on that trust line.
Although slightly off-topic for this guide, the NoRipple flag on a trust line can only be enabled if the balance on the trust line is not negative. This prevents abuse of the feature to default on debts shown in the trust line balance.
For more details, please refer to the [official documentation](https://xrpl.org/ja/docs/concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/rippling/).
</Aside>


The cause was that the trust line was set before enabling the `Rippling flag` on Charlie's account, the issuer of the DOJ token.

To generally allow token transfers between users, you need to enable the issuer's account `Rippling` first, and then have users set up their trust lines.

In the next chapter, we will explain how to disable the NoRipple flag using the `TrustSet` transaction.
