In the previous chapters, Alice and Bob obtained the right (trust line) to receive `DOJ` tokens issued by Charlie.

Alice has already received `1,000 DOJ` tokens from Charlie, so let's try sending `100 DOJ` from Alice to Bob.

## Prerequisites

This guide proceeds with the following characters:

- Charlie (Token Issuer)
- Alice (Sender)
- Bob (Recipient)

## Create the Script

The following is a script to send `DOJ` tokens from Alice to Bob.

<Steps>

1. Create a new file named `payment_token_ab.js` in your project directory.
2. Paste the following code into `payment_token_ab.js`.

    ```javascript
    const xrpl = require('xrpl');

    async function paymentTokenAB() {
        // Connect to the Testnet server
        const client = new xrpl.Client('wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233');
        await client.connect();

        // Set Alice's wallet
        const senderWallet = xrpl.Wallet.fromSecret('alice_wallet_secret_here');

        // Set Bob's wallet address
        const recipientWalletAddress = 'bob_wallet_address_here';

        // Set the wallet address of the token issuer (Charlie)
        const issuerWalletAddress = 'charlie_wallet_address_here';

        const currencyCode = 'DOJ'; // Token currency code
        const amount = '100'; // Amount of tokens to send

        const response = await client.submitAndWait(
            {
                TransactionType: 'Payment', // Payment
                Account: senderWallet.address, // Alice's address
                Destination: recipientWalletAddress, // Bob's address
                Amount: {
                    issuer: issuerWalletAddress, // Token issuer's address (Charlie)
                    currency: currencyCode, // DOJ
                    value: amount, // 100
                },
            },
            { wallet: senderWallet } // Authenticate with Alice's wallet
        );

        // Output the result to the console
        console.log('Transaction result:', response);

        // Call the client.disconnect() method to disconnect from the server
        client.disconnect();
    }

    paymentTokenAB().catch(console.error);
    ```

    1. Enter Alice's testnet secret key in `alice_wallet_secret_here`.
    2. Enter Bob's testnet address in `bob_wallet_address_here`.
    3. Enter Charlie's testnet address in `charlie_wallet_address_here`.
</Steps>

## Run the Script

<Steps>

1. Run the following command in the command line to execute the script.

    ```bash
    node payment_token_ab.js
    ```

2. Check the console result.

    ```bash
    {
        id: 14,
        result: {
            Account: 'rQr8KfkCQcpqvFwmRspDoaL36reZhcdaeA', // Sender's address (Alice)
            Amount: {
                currency: 'DOJ',
                issuer: 'rh8xETfGs1Ktizj9EXZb5QpW4aqk8bWUSU', // Token issuer's address (Charlie)
                value: '100'
            },
            DeliverMax: {
                currency: 'DOJ',
                issuer: 'rh8xETfGs1Ktizj9EXZb5QpW4aqk8bWUSU',
                value: '100'
            },
            Destination: 'rDNVaJJSp9iQmHC8YAAwHytnLP9aXEPhDw', // Bob's address
            Fee: '12', // Transaction fee: 12 drops
            Flags: 0,
            LastLedgerSequence: 475731,
            Sequence: 474065,
            SigningPubKey: 'ED2924DBD08E093DD7FC9C35B8DCEBD74CA4C8349D68D7BF566AD6C2533B8BB865',
            TransactionType: 'Payment',
            TxnSignature: '54F6F1198988F0F446B674119D383B73629DB6602B68E740BAE8A68E60F88A9E2D305D7B0113E8906433AB26AFAC32551FB5E2A059E43CD708E71A4281D80007', // Hash value
            ctid: 'C0074241004B0001',
            date: 768405010,
            hash: '9F0350EC836C5A76AF1989FE5591DD3A91AD4345601AEA1187DD67EE7E820732',
            inLedger: 475713,
            ledger_index: 475713, // Ledger index number
            meta: {
                AffectedNodes: [Array],
                TransactionIndex: 75,
                TransactionResult: 'tecPATH_DRY' // Failure
            },
            validated: true // Validated transaction
        },
        type: 'response'
    }
    ```

    It seems that this Payment Transaction from Alice to Bob has failed.

    The `TransactionResult` of `tecPATH_DRY` is a status (tec code) indicating a payment failure. Let's learn about status (tec codes) here.

    <Aside title='What is tecPATH_DRY?'>
        It is one of the status (tec codes) indicating a payment transaction failure. This error occurs when there is insufficient asset or liquidity in the "payment path" specified in the transaction.
        Simply put, it means that there are not enough resources required for the transaction. If this error occurs, you may resolve it by trying another payment path or adjusting conditions such as the transaction amount or counterparty.
        For more details about payment paths, refer to the [official documentation](https://xrpl.org/ja/docs/concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/paths/).
    </Aside>

    You can also check the list of tec codes [here](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/transaction-results/tec-codes/).
</Steps>

## Token Transfers Between Users

Although Alice and Bob have set up trust lines, the token transfer failed.

Why did it fail?

First, let's study the concept of IOU tokens!

<Aside title='What is an IOU?'>
IOU stands for "I Owe You." In XRPL, users can issue tokens representing assets other than XRP (such as USD or points), and these are called IOU tokens.
An IOU represents a claim against the issuer, who promises to provide assets equivalent to its value in the future.
</Aside>

### How Token Transfers Work

In XRPL, tokens are generally only transferable through the issuer. This is because tokens issued on XRPL are considered liabilities.

Thinking of a real-world example, just as it would be odd for someone to freely send points issued by a specific store to others, XRPL also generally prevents third parties from directly transferring tokens. Allowing transactions only through the issuer maintains the trust and management of the tokens (liabilities).

### How to Transfer Tokens?

As mentioned, tokens in XRPL are generally only transferable through the issuer. However, by changing the settings of the issuer account, it can be treated as an intermediary, allowing IOU token transfers between users other than the issuer.

This balance adjustment feature is called [Rippling](https://xrpl.org/ja/docs/concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/rippling/), which refers to the exchange between multiple users holding trust lines for the same currency.

In this guide, we need to enable `Rippling` for Charlie's account.

The method for enabling it will be explained in the next chapter.
