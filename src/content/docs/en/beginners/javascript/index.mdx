This is the "Level 1" curriculum for developing XRPL in JavaScript!

The code based content is relatively easy, but it closely relates to understanding the foundational `Ripple protocol` on which XRPL is built. Please pay attention to fully understanding these concepts while proceeding.

Additionally, the following environment is required to execute the content of this section.

## Required Tools

- Text Editor ([VS Code is recommended](/editor/install/))
- [Node.js Installation](/getting-started/node-js/)

## Preparation

Before starting, please refer to [Starting a Project](en/basics/javascript/started/) of this course to create a project in your local environment.

## Goals

- Understand the concept of tokens in XRPL
- Understand the concept of trust lines
- Be able to set up a trust line

## Prerequisites

This guide series proceeds with the following characters:

- Charlie (Token Issuer)
