import { Aside, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

In the previous chapter, Alice set a trust line for the token issued by Charlie.

In this chapter, we aim to confirm if the trust line has been set correctly, and at the same time, learn about the `public methods` of `rippled`!

To retrieve account information, use the `account methods`, which are `public methods` of `rippled`.

## Prerequisites

This guide proceeds with the following characters:

- Charlie (Token Issuer)
- Alice (Token Recipient)

## Create the Script

To check the list of currencies an account can send or receive, use the [account_currencies](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/public-api-methods/account-methods/account_currencies/#account_currencies) command.

<Steps>

1. Create a new file named `check_account_currencies.js` in your project directory.
2. Paste the following code into `check_account_currencies.js`.

    This example creates a reusable method. The `checkAccountCurrencies()` method retrieves information based on the `accountAddress` passed as an argument.

     <Aside>Note: The `try catch` exception handling method is incorporated within the method. It has been used in previous chapters, but beginners should also learn this method.</Aside>

    ```javascript
    const xrpl = require('xrpl');

    async function checkAccountCurrencies(accountAddress) {
        // Connect to the Testnet server
        const client = new xrpl.Client('wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233');

        // Call the client.connect() method to connect to the server
        // Use await to wait until the connection is complete
        await client.connect();

        try {
            // Retrieve the token list using the account_currencies command
            const response = await client.request({
                command: 'account_currencies',
                account: accountAddress,
                ledger_index: 'validated' // Specify 'validated' to retrieve from a validated ledger
            });

            // Output the result to the console
            console.log('Account Lines:', response);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error retrieving account lines:', error);
        }

        // Call the client.disconnect() method to disconnect from the server
        await client.disconnect();
    }

    const charlieAddress = 'charlie_wallet_address_here'; // Charlie's address
    checkAccountCurrencies(charlieAddress); // Pass the account address as an argument to the function

    const aliceAddress = 'alice_wallet_address_here'; // Alice's address
    checkAccountCurrencies(aliceAddress);
    ```

    1. Enter Charlie's testnet address in `charlie_wallet_address_here`.
    2. Enter Alice's testnet address in `alice_wallet_address_here`.
</Steps>

## Run the Script

<Steps>

1. Run the following command in the command line to execute the script.

    ```bash
    node check_account_currencies.js
    ```

2. If successful, the console will display the following.

    ```bash
    Account Lines: { // Charlie's information
        id: 1,
        result: {
            ledger_hash: 'D05315702B8617B192FB1666BF05F588A457C30D0F493C4FA802BAABDE34209E',
            ledger_index: 441812, // Ledger index number (source of this data)
            receive_currencies: [], // Array of tokens that can be received
            send_currencies: [ 'DOJ' ], // Array of tokens that can be sent
            validated: true // Whether the data is from the latest validated ledger
        },
        type: 'response'
    }
    Account Lines: { // Alice's information
        id: 1,
        result: {
            ledger_hash: 'D05315702B8617B192FB1666BF05F588A457C30D0F493C4FA802BAABDE34209E',
            ledger_index: 441812,
            receive_currencies: [ 'DOJ' ], // Array of tokens that Alice can receive
            send_currencies: [],
            validated: true
        },
        type: 'response'
    }
    ```

    From Charlie's account information, which is the issuer of the DOJ token, `DOJ` is included in send_currencies, and from Alice's account information, `DOJ` is included in the receive_currencies array, confirming that Alice can receive the `DOJ` token.

    This shows that XRPL maintains account information (state) for each wallet and transactions are strictly verified based on this information.
</Steps>

## What are ledger_index and ledger_hash?

The ledger_hash displayed in the console log is a unique hash value for the ledger. In this sample, data was retrieved from the 441812th validated ledger.

Let's check the [ledger](https://testnet.xrpl.org/ledgers/441812) validated at the 441812th position on the testnet.

![Details of XRPL's testnet ledger index number 441812.](../../../../assets/images/beginners/img-livenet-ledger-441812.webp)

The ledger hash value for this ledger (`441812`) is `D05315702B8617B192FB1666BF05F588A457C30D0F493C4FA802BAABDE34209E`, which matches the console log above.
Understanding the overall picture of XRPL is important, and visually confirming and understanding each meaning in this way is crucial.

Additionally, [XRPL Explorer](https://livenet.xrpl.org/) offers a [testnet version](https://testnet.xrpl.org/) as well, which is one of the necessary tools for development, so be sure to bookmark it.
